# ML_IDS2018
The code investigates the application of classical machine learning algorithms for network intrusion detection using the CSE CIC IDS2018 dataset, a modern benchmark that captures realistic traffic and a diverse set of contemporary cyberattacks. 

Network Intrusion dataset (CSE-CIC-IDS 2018) --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html)

Summary:

Test a number of popular supervised  ML algorithms for identifying effective and efficient anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (ML-AIDS) of networks and computers.

Supervised ML algorithms in this study include:  decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LOGREG), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Extra Trees (ET), LightGBM (LGBM).

Tasks: Implement different models of these algorithms, apply parameter tuning and model training for each algorithm to find optimal classifiers, and perform required evaluations.
