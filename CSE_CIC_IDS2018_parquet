The parquet files (dataset for each day) can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhoogla/csecicids2018
The dataset is publicly available through several sources: the main repository at the University of New Brunswick (https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html), 
the AWS Open Data Registry (https://registry.opendata.aws/cse-cic-ids2018/), and community platforms like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhoogla/csecicids2018), 
which ensures open access for research.
